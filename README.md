# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to use the dataset to assist the foundation in predicticting where to make investments. Using the featires in the data set a binary classifiier was created that is capabel of predicting a succesful candidate for funding from Alphabet Soup. The data set consistis of more than 34,000 organizations that have recieved funds from Alphabet Soup. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

* **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
* **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
* **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
* **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
* **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
* **ORGANIZATION**—Organization type
* **STATUS**—Active status
* **INCOME**_AMT—Income classification
* **SPECIAL**_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
* **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
